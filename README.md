# Hi, i'm Akshat and i'm a self taught full-stack, and desktop app developer.


i love automating the mundane tasks, and love producing automation tools for WebScaping. I am also a fullstack developer, with experience in backend frameworks like spring-boot, Django and Flask.
I have experience in several languages and pick up new languages quite easily
