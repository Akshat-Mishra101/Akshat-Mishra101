# Hi, i'm Akshat 




I'm a self taught full-stack, and desktop app developer with several years of experience in designing and building desktop apps. 
I design my desktop apps mostly in Java and python, but i can quickly switch languages depending upon the complexity of the task.








i love automating the mundane tasks, and love producing automation tools for WebScaping. I am also a fullstack developer, with experience in backend frameworks like spring-boot, Django and Flask.
I have experience in several languages and pick up new languages quite easily
